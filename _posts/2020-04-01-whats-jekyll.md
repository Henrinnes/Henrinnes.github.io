title: What's RanCTGAN?
---

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a ransomware detection framework, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful ransomware detection systems of evolving ransomware variants. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/Henrinnes/RanCTGAN/README.md):

  > RanCTGAN is a framework for ransomware detection that addresses data imbalance, lack of explainability and predictive uncertainty through an integrated approach. The framework combines data augmentation techniques (SMOTE and a Conditional TabGAN (CTGAN)), uncertainty quantification using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) with Monte Carlo dropout, and explainability via SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations).

It's an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here.
